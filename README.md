## Homework 6:  Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This **project** challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) was used to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. `localStorage` was used to store any persistent data.

## Description

- This app will allow user to search the current Weather for any city of his/her choice.
- When a city is searched, user will be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city will be added to the search history.
- User is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. 
-User then is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. Green for favorable, yellow for moderate and red for severe conditions.
-User is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity in the future 5-day forecast seccion. 
- User will be able to view in the search history column all the city searches he/she has made. 

## Review

After completing this application I was able to create a current and future weather forecast that stores in the local storage the information entered by the user, and this information persists when page is refreshed. To complete this project I had to get help from many sites listed below:
